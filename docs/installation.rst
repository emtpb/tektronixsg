Stable release
==============

To install Tektronix Signal Generator Interface, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install git+*http-link-to-repo*

This is the preferred method to install Tektronix Signal Generator Interface, as it
will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
Note that on systems that still use legacy Python as the default, you will have
to use ``pip3`` instead of ``pip``, as Tektronix Signal Generator Interface only
supports Python 3.
